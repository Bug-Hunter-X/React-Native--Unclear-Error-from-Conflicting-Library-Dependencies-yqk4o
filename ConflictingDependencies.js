This error occurs when you are using a third-party library in your React Native project that has a dependency conflict with another library.  For example, if two libraries both depend on different versions of the same package, this can lead to unexpected behavior and crashes.  The error message itself might not be very descriptive, often manifesting as a generic error during runtime or build process.
