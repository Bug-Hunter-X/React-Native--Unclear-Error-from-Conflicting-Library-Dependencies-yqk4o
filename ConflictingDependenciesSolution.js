The solution involves carefully examining your `package.json` file and identifying the conflicting packages. You can use tools like `npm ls` or `yarn why` to trace dependencies.  Often, using a specific version of a package in the package.json file to resolve version conflicts is effective.   If the conflict is complex, you may need to selectively remove or replace certain libraries, opting for alternatives that have better compatibility.  Consider using `npm-check-updates` or a similar tool to identify outdated packages that may cause or contribute to the issue.
